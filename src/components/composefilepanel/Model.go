// ComposeFilePanel replaces the PlaceholderPanel on the Files page. The
// minimal version shows the active compose file's path in the title and a
// read-only, scrollable view of its raw contents. E opens the file in the
// user's editor.
//
// The panel is the sole component on its page, so it fills the whole body
// row (both panel widths plus the gutter). It is not split into a list and
// a details pane - that is a later-phase extension to browse multiple
// compose files.
// The panel is the only component on its page, so it is always focused:
// there is no second panel for Tab to move to, and tracking SetFocusMsg
// would let Tab strand focus on a component id that does not exist here,
// blurring the one panel the page has. Always-focused also means the E key
// and scrolling always work, matching what the footer advertises.
