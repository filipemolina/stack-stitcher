// A stamped value wins - that is a release, and it says so. Otherwise the

// cases cleanly:
//
//   - Built from a checkout: there is a vcs.revision, so the short commit is
//     the version. The toolchain also synthesizes a v0.0.0-<date>-<hash>
//     pseudo-version here, which says the same thing at three times the
//     length and reads like a release that never existed.
//   - Installed with `go install ...@v0.1.0`: a module download has no VCS
//     info at all, so Main.Version is the only answer, and it is the right
//     one.
